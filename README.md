*Stevens Institute of Technology – Master of Engineering in Robotics*  

This repository contains coursework, assignments, and projects completed for **EE 553: Engineering Programming, C++**, a graduate-level course at Stevens Institute of Technology.  

---

## 📚 Course Description
This course was a **fast-paced introduction to the C++ programming language**, with an emphasis on good programming practices and how to be an effective programmer. Topics include:  
- Object-oriented programming concepts  
- Static and dynamic memory management  
- Advantages of C++ over other languages  
- Optimization and performance considerations  
- File I/O (read, write, append)  
- Decision-making and problem-solving with C++  

Applications span many engineering domains, including communications systems, embedded systems, smart grids, robotics, Internet, and enterprise networks.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, students were able to:  
1. Recognize the basic concepts of C++ programming.  
2. Construct C++ statements, data types, arrays, strings, and pointers.  
3. Debug common errors using IDE tools (e.g., CLion, Code::Blocks).  
4. Manage memory allocation and deallocation appropriately.  
5. Apply object-oriented programming to solve real problems.  
6. Analyze C++ programs based on developer and end-user requirements.  
7. Use appropriate C++ terminology in problem-solving.
